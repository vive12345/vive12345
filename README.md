## Hi there 👋

# Hi, I'm Vipsa Kamani 👋

🧑‍💻 **Software Engineer** | 🎓 **M.S. Software Engineering @ ASU** | 💡 **Full-Stack Developer** 😊

## About Me

My programming journey began in childhood when my uncle would visit us from the USA. I'd watch him work on his laptop, typing mysterious commands on a black screen that seemed like magic to me. I'd sit there wondering what exactly he was doing - little did I know my uncle was a software engineer! I got my first kids laptop from him and spent hours mimicking the way he typed, completely fascinated. But my screen wasn't black and studded with white lines of some zebration - mine had a bunch of games!

During my 10th-grade summer break, boredom led me to enroll in a computer class where my first teacher, **Urvi Joshi ma'am**, ignited my passion for programming. When I solved my first pattern problem completely on my own, she told me I should definitely follow this path. That moment changed everything.

After 12th grade, when it was time to decide my career path, there was only one thing I could think about - becoming a software engineer. I pursued my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering, then applied to ASU where I was fortunate to receive the **Namu Scholarship** for their Software Engineering program. How could I say no?

Unknowingly, today I'm doing that same "cool thing" my uncle did on his black screen. The magic is real, and now I'm creating it! 😄

## 🚀 Current Focus

Currently building scalable applications and exploring **cloud technologies**, **computer vision**, and **full-stack development**. Passionate about creating solutions that make a real impact - from automating university processes to building educational tools.
