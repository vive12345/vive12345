# Hi, I'm Vipsa Kamani 👋

🧑‍💻 **Software Engineer** | 🎓 **M.S. Software Engineering @ ASU (Graduating in Dec 2025)** 

WHEN ?

My 🔥 **curiosity** 🔥 for programming began in childhood when my uncle would visit us from abroad. I'd watch him work on his laptop, typing mysterious commands on a black screen that seemed like magic to me.

During my 10th grade summer break, boredom led me to enroll in a computer class where my first teacher, Urvi mam, ignited my 🔥 **interest** 🔥 for programming. When I solved my first pattern problem completely on my own, she told me I should definitely follow this path.

After 12th grade, when it was time to decide my career path, there was only one thing I could think about. So, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, then applied to Arizona State University where I was fortunate to receive the 🏆 **Namu Scholarship at ASU** 🏆 for their **Master's in Software Engineering program**. This is how my 💡 **interest** 💡 transformed into 🔥 **passion** 🔥.
